Shared Dependencies:

1. Playwright: This is a Node.js library to automate the Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers with a single API. It will be used in both "playwright_setup.js" and "reddit_scraper.js" for web scraping.

2. Node.js: The runtime environment to execute JavaScript code outside of a browser. It will be used in both "playwright_setup.js" and "reddit_scraper.js".

3. Reddit URL: The URL of the Reddit page to be scraped. It will be used in "reddit_scraper.js" and possibly in "playwright_setup.js" if the setup includes initial navigation.

4. JSON: The data format in which the scraped data will be stored. It will be used in "reddit_scraper.js" for structuring the scraped data and in "data.json" for storing the data.

5. DOM Elements IDs: The specific identifiers of the DOM elements on the Reddit page from which data will be extracted. These will be used in "reddit_scraper.js".

6. Functions: Functions for initializing Playwright, navigating to the Reddit page, extracting the data, and storing the data in JSON format. These will be used in "playwright_setup.js" and "reddit_scraper.js".

7. File System (fs) module: This is a Node.js built-in module for interacting with the file system. It will be used in "reddit_scraper.js" to write the scraped data to "data.json".

8. Exported Variables: Variables that are defined in one module but used in another. For example, the Playwright browser instance might be initialized in "playwright_setup.js" and then used in "reddit_scraper.js".
