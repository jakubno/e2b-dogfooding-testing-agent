1. Playwright: All the files will share the Playwright dependency as it is the main tool used for web scraping in this project.

2. Reddit URL: The URL of the Reddit page to be scraped will be shared across the files. It will be used in the "reddit_scraper.py" file to navigate to the page and in the "main.py" file to initiate the scraping process.

3. Data Schema: The structure of the data to be scraped from Reddit will be shared across the files. This will include the specific data points to be extracted (e.g., post title, author, date, etc.). This schema will be used in "reddit_scraper.py" to extract the data and in "data.json" to store the data.

4. JSON: The JSON module will be a shared dependency as it will be used to store the scraped data in a structured format in the "data.json" file. It may also be used in "reddit_scraper.py" and "main.py" for handling the data.

5. Function Names: Functions for initiating the Playwright browser, navigating to the Reddit page, extracting the data, and storing the data will be shared across the "main.py" and "reddit_scraper.py" files.

6. DOM Element IDs: The IDs of the DOM elements on the Reddit page that contain the data to be scraped will be shared across the files. These will be used in "reddit_scraper.py" to locate the data on the page.

7. Error Messages: Any error messages or exceptions that are defined for handling potential issues during the scraping process will be shared across the "main.py" and "reddit_scraper.py" files.
